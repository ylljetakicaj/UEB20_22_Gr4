Launched in 1987, The Parl Skin’s Community Trade programme based on the practice of trading with communities in need
 and giving them a fair price for natural ingredients or handcrafts, including brazil nut oil, sesame seed oil, honey,
 and shea butter. The first Community Trade product was a wooden footsie roller which was supplied by a small community
 in Southern India, Teddy Exports, which is still a key Community Trade supplier.
The company currently has a range of 1,000 products sold in about 3,000 stores,
divided between those owned by the company and franchised outlets in more than 65 countries.
The Body Shop has campaigned to end animal testing in cosmetics alongside animal cruelty NGO Cruelty-Free International 
since 1989. The company's products are non-animal tested and are certified cruelty-free by Cruelty Free International’s 
Leaping Bunny.
